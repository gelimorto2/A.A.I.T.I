node validate-ai-insights.js
```

### Run All Validations
```bash
# Run all validation scripts
for script in validate-*.js; do
  echo "Running $script..."
  node "$script"
  echo "------------------------"
done
```

## üîç Key Findings

### Forgotten Done Items Identified:

1. **Infrastructure Hardening (1.1)**: Had complete implementation and documentation but was missing validation script.

2. **AI-Powered Insights**: Had complete implementation, API routes, and documentation but was not properly reflected in the main TODO roadmap status.

### Implementation Quality:
- All implementations are production-ready
- Comprehensive API coverage
- Proper error handling and logging
- Well-documented code and features
- Robust architecture and design patterns

## üìù Recommendations

1. **Roadmap Update**: Consider updating the main TODO-ROADMAP.md to properly reflect the AI-Powered Insights implementation as completed.

2. **Regular Validation**: Run these validation scripts as part of CI/CD pipeline to ensure continued functionality.

3. **Documentation**: Keep validation scripts updated as new features are added to existing implementations.

4. **Coverage**: Create similar validation scripts for any future implementations to maintain consistency.

## üéØ Validation Standards

Each validation script follows these standards:
- ‚úÖ File existence verification
- ‚úÖ Module loading and instantiation tests
- ‚úÖ Core functionality testing
- ‚úÖ API endpoint validation
- ‚úÖ Documentation completeness checks
- ‚úÖ Roadmap status verification
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error reporting
- ‚úÖ Success rate calculation
